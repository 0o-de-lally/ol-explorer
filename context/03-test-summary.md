# OL Explorer Test Summary

This document provides a summary of the testing infrastructure, test coverage, and test results for the OL Explorer blockchain explorer project.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit and Integration Testing with Jest

The project uses Jest with React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. Key configurations include:

- **jest.config.js**: Configures Jest with the `jest-expo` preset and sets up proper transformation patterns for React Native
- **jest.setup.js**: Sets up mocks for AsyncStorage, Expo Constants, and React Navigation
- **global.d.ts**: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Jest matchers

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

Cypress is used for end-to-end testing of the web version of the application:

- **cypress.config.js**: Configures Cypress to run against the Expo web server
- **cypress/e2e/home.cy.js**: Tests the home page functionality

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow is set up to run tests automatically:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest tests for unit and integration testing
- Cypress tests for end-to-end testing

## Test Coverage

### Components

The following components have unit tests:

1. **BlockchainStats**: Tests loading state, rendering of blockchain stats, and proper testID propagation
2. **TransactionsList**: Tests loading state, rendering of transactions, navigation on transaction press, and proper testID propagation

### Screens

1. **HomeScreen**: Tests data fetching on mount, polling for updates, and cleanup on unmount

### Store

The blockchain store and its actions are extensively tested through component tests.

### Hooks

1. **useSdk**: The SDK hook is tested through mocking in component tests

## Test Results

All tests are passing successfully. The test suite provides good coverage of core functionality:

## Test Improvements

While the current test coverage is good, the following improvements could be made:

1. **Test Environment**: Add a custom React Native testing environment to improve test performance
2. **Mock API Responses**: Create more realistic mock data for the SDK responses
3. **Component Snapshots**: Add snapshot tests for UI components to track visual changes
4. **Edge Cases**: Add more tests for error handling and edge cases
5. **Theme Testing**: Add tests for the theme switching functionality
6. **Navigation Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests for the navigation flow
7. **Search Functionality**: Add tests for the search functionality once implemented

## CI Workflow Integration

The CI workflow is now set up to:

1. Run TypeScript type checking to ensure type safety
2. Run ESLint to ensure code quality
3. Run Jest tests to verify component functionality
4. Set up and run Cypress tests against the Expo web server
5. Upload test coverage reports to track coverage over time

All tests are required to pass before merging to the main branch, ensuring code quality and stability.
