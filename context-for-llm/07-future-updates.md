# OL Explorer - Future-Proofing Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for maintaining and future-proofing the OL Explorer blockchain explorer project to ensure its continued functionality, security, and relevance.

## Dependency Management Strategy

### Regular Dependency Updates

To keep the project secure and compatible with the latest technologies:

1. **Monthly Scheduled Updates**:
   - Run `npm outdated` to identify outdated packages
   - Update non-breaking dependencies: `npm update`
   - Test after each update to ensure stability

2. **Major Version Migration**:
   - Evaluate major version updates individually
   - Create separate branches for testing major updates
   - Update documentation with migration notes

3. **Security Updates**:
   - Configure GitHub security alerts
   - Prioritize security-related updates
   - Set up automated dependency scanning with tools like Dependabot

### Dependency Update Workflow

```bash
# Create a dedicated branch for updates
git checkout -b dependency-updates

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update non-breaking dependencies
npm update

# Run tests to verify compatibility
npm test
npm run cypress:run

# If successful, commit changes
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Create a pull request for review
```
