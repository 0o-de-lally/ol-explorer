# Responsive Design Improvements in Open Libra Explorer

We've improved the responsive design approach across the codebase by replacing JavaScript-based responsive logic with proper NativeWind v4 CSS classes. This enables a more maintainable, scalable approach to responsive design.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed JavaScript-based Screen Size Detection

- Removed `useWindowDimensions` hook and manual `isMobile` flags
- Replaced conditional rendering with CSS-based visibility classes
- Improved code maintainability by centralizing responsive behavior in CSS

### 2. Improved Components with Responsive Classes

The following components were updated:

#### Header Component
```tsx
// Before
{isMobile ? (
  <MobileLayout />
) : (
  <DesktopLayout />
)}

// After
<View className="md:hidden">
  <MobileLayout />
</View>
<View className="hidden md:block">
  <DesktopLayout />
</View>
```

#### Footer Component
Updated to use responsive classes instead of JavaScript conditions, following the same pattern as the Header component.

#### TransactionsList and AccountTransactionsList
- Table headers now use `hidden md:flex` instead of conditional rendering
- Mobile and desktop versions of transaction items both render in the DOM but are conditionally displayed using CSS classes

#### TransactionDetails
- Removed direct screen width detection
- Implemented proper responsive views with CSS classes
- Made the hash display adaptable without JavaScript conditions

### 3. Layout Component Improvements

- Updated `TwoColumn` component to use responsive classes instead of JavaScript width calculations
- Improved `Grid` component to use NativeWind's responsive grid classes
- Added appropriate `Row` and `Column` components for flex layouts
- Created responsive `Card` component with consistent styling
- Removed manual dimension checks that caused inconsistent responsive behavior

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Improved Performance**: Less JavaScript computation and fewer re-renders
2. **Better Maintainability**: Responsive logic is centralized in CSS classes
3. **Consistency**: All components follow the same pattern for responsiveness
4. **Scalability**: Easier to extend responsive patterns to new components
5. **Standards Compliance**: Follows best practices for React Native with NativeWind v4
6. **Dark Mode Support**: Better integration with the "class" strategy for dark mode
7. **Font Consistency**: Proper handling of font families including Inter and Geist Mono

## Continuing Improvements

To maintain this approach going forward:

1. Always use responsive Tailwind classes (`md:`, `lg:`) for breakpoint-specific styling
2. Avoid manual dimension checks with `useWindowDimensions`
3. Follow the mobile-first approach (design for mobile, then add responsive classes for larger screens)
4. Use the layout components from `/components/Layout` for consistent layouts
5. Use `font-data` class for numerical data display
6. Use `dark:` prefix for dark mode specific styling
